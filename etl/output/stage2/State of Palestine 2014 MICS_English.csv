"A The age-specific fertility rate is defined as the number of live births to women in a specific age group during a specified period, divided by the average number of women in that age group during the same period, expressed per 1,000 women. The age-specific fertility rate for women age 15-19 years is also termed as the adolescent birth rate.
The total fertility rate (TFR) is calculated by summing the age-specific fertility rates calculated for each of the 5-year age groups of women, from age 15 through to age 49. The TFR denotes the average number of children to which a woman will have given birth by the end of her reproductive years (by age 50) if current fertility rates prevailed.",,,,,,
